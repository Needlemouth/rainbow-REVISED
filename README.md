rainbow-REVISED
===============

I HAVE CHANGED THE STYLE SHEET TO UTILIZE THE BORDER COLOR INSTEAD OF THE BACKGROUND COLOR, THUS, ELEMINATING THE :AFTER PSEUDO SELECTOR.

I HAVE ALSO USED IDs TO IDENTIFY THE DOM ELEMENTS. I INITALLY WAS GOING TO MAKE TWO RAINBOWS AND MULTIPLE CLOUDS SO I USED CLASSES. I RAN OUT OF TIME.
