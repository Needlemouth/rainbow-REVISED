rainbow-REVISED
===============

I have changed the style sheet to utilize the border color instead of the background color, thus, eliminating the unecessary :after pseudo selectors.

I have, also, used IDs to identify the DOM elements. I initially was going to create TWO rainbows and multiple clouds but, I ran out of time.
